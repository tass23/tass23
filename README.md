- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raist/Tass, or A.J. to some.
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently using GitHub as a resource for developing and hosting a custom Ultima Online free shard called
- UO-The Expanse, which can be found at: www.uoexpanse.com.
- 
- This is an extensively customized version of UO Stygian Abyss v7.0.12 running on a hybrid emulator engine from
- RunUO2.0/Orb3.0/ServUO Pub 54, with thousands of C# files and hundreds of edits, plus more custom content created
- for players inside the game itself with support from over 4,600 custom scripts and new artwork. Combined with all
- the artwork files in Photoshop format, over 400 pages of PDF documentation and tutorials, plus special tools made
- specifically to work with UO free shard projects, and an intranet website in HTM format that contains descriptions
- of the custom content that is installed on the free shard.
- 
- More information for the UO-The Expanse edu Repack can be found here, along with a link to the installer:
- https://www.uoexpanse.com/uote_pub.php
- 
- I formerly hosted an older ServUO Pub 54 Repo, but that has been removed since there is a more current repo
- available from ServUO with support.
