- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raist, or A.J. to some.
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently using GitHub as a resource for compiling a custom UO freeshard called UO-The Expanse,
-    which can be found at: www.uoexpanse.com. This is an extensively customized version of a freeshard,
-    with thousands of edits and files, plus more custom content created for players inside the 'shard.
-    I am also hosting an older ServUO Pub 54 Repo for posterity, but I am not supporting it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Right here is best.
